This textbook is an introduction to the fundamental concepts and practical programming skills from Data Science that are increasingly employed in a variety of language-centered fields and sub-fields applied to the task of quantitative text analysis. It is geared towards advanced undergraduates, graduate students, and researchers looking to expand their methodological toolbox.

The content is currently under development. Feedback is welcome and can be provided through the [hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/) service. A toolbar interface to this service is located on the right sidebar.

**Author**

Dr. Jerid Francom is Associate Professor of Spanish and Linguistics at Wake Forest University. His research focuses on the use of large-scale language archives (corpora) from a variety of sources (news, social media, and other internet sources) to better understand the linguistic and cultural similarities and differences between language varieties for both scholarly and pedagogical projects. He has published on topics including the development, annotation, and evaluation of linguistic corpora and analyzed corpora through corpus, psycholinguistic, and computational methodologies. He also has experience working with and teaching statistical programming with R.

## Build information {-}

<!-- This may be a unique textbook compared to others you have seen. It has been created using R itself --specifically using an R package called `bookdown` [@R-bookdown]. This R package makes it possible to write, execute ('run'), and display code and results within the text. The website for this textbook is hosted with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and the complete source is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/lin380). -->

<!-- and automatically updated after every commit by [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org).  -->

This version of the textbook was built with `r sessioninfo::platform_info()[[1]]` on `r sessioninfo::os_name()` with the following packages: 

```{r, echo = FALSE, results="asis", eval=TRUE}
pkgs <- sessioninfo::package_info(dependencies = FALSE)
df <- tibble(
  package = pkgs$package,
  version = pkgs$ondiskversion,
  source = gsub("@", "\\\\@", pkgs$source)
)
knitr::kable(df, format = "markdown")
```


```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown', 'languageR', 'quanteda.corpora', 'rvest', 'rsyntax', 'rtweet', 'quanteda', 'quanteda.textstats', 'quanteda.textmodels'
), 'packages.bib')
```
