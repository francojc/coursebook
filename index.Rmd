## Build and session information {-}

This coursebook was written in [bookdown](http://bookdown.org/) inside [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/). The website is hosted with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and the complete source is available from [GitHub](https://github.com/lin380).

<!-- and automatically updated after every commit by [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org).  -->


This version of the coursebook was built with:

```{r echo=FALSE}
# needed because new_session is set to true in _bookdown.yml
all_pkgs <- renv::dependencies(path = "DESCRIPTION") %>% 
  pull(Package) 
session <- devtools::session_info(pkgs = all_pkgs)
session$platform
```

And depends on these packages:

```{r echo=FALSE}
session$packages %>% 
  select(package, loadedversion, date, source) %>% 
  DT::datatable(rownames = FALSE,
                class = 'cell-border stripe',
                filter = list(position = 'top'),
                options = list(pageLength = nrow(session$packages), 
                           autoWidth = TRUE,
                           bInfo = FALSE,
                           paging = FALSE))
```



```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
