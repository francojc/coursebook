Overview ... DRAFT

In this chapter I will build on the notions of data and dataset from the previous chapter. I will underscore that the aim of statistical analysis is to uncover patterns in datasets. There are two basic aims that underlie statistical analysis. Either the goal is to probe the data to test a hypothesis about the relationship between the observations or to explore the potential relationships. These distinctions are grouped into Inference or Exploration statistics. Fundamental to either approach is the use of descriptive statistics. These methods aim to provide researchers a better understanding of the structure of the data, prepare the researcher to make decisions about which statistical tests are most appropriate, and to safeguard against false assumptions (missing data, data distributions, etc.)


## Descriptive statistics

### Information values

- Categorical variables
- Continuous variables

Maximizing information, minimizing loss

### Summaries

- Central tendency
- ...

### Distributions


### Correction

- Missing data
- Skew
  - Continuous variables
- Outliers
  - Trimming


## Analytic statistics

### Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Bottom-up approach, hypothesis generating

### Inferential data analysis (IDA)

Top-down approach, hypothesis testing

### Predictive data analysis (PDA)

Mixed approach, can be used for the generation of hypotheses or to test hypotheses

## Reporting

- Descriptive analysis
  - Procedures to diagnose and correct
- Analytic analysis
  - Communicate findings in statistical appropriate forms
    - Depends on the analytic statistic(s) applied
