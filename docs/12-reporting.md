# Overview {-#communication-overview}

In this section I cover the steps in presenting the findings of the research both as a research document and as a reproducible research project. Both research documents and reproducible projects are fundamental components of modern scientific inquiry. On the one hand a research document provides readers a detailed summary of the main import of the research study. On the other hand making the research project available to interested readers ensures that the scientific community can gain insight into the process implemented in the research and thus enables researchers to vet and extend this research to build a more robust and verifiable research base.

Finally, we will explore how to apply field-specific and publishing house formats to various document formats including Word, PDF, HTML, and ePub.
