### Data




**Egbert, J., Larsson, T., & Biber, D. (2020). Doing Linguistics with a Corpus: Methodological Considerations for the Everyday User. Cambridge University Press.** [@Egbert2020] 

Chapter 2 "Getting to know your corpus" (2.1 and 2.3)

Section 2.1 considers the importance of representativeness for corpus-based research and the idea of generalization. It explores how "similar" data can vary in important ways and that the research question and data/ corpus selection are intertwined. In short the results are only as good as the data in. All samples are skewed (to some degree) and it is important to acknowledge and document the potential limitations. 

(Note: the concepts of sampling procedures are not covered.)


**Biber, D. (1993). Representativeness in corpus design. Literary and Linguistic Computing, 8(4), 243–257.** [@Biber:1993]

Discusses representativeness in more detail. Includes target population, stratified and proportional sampling, sampling within texts, and issues regarding sample size.

(Note: this article gets quite dense starting in section 4. Sections 1-3 might be good for this course.)


**Atkins, S., Clear, J., & Ostler, N. (1992). Corpus Design Criteria. Literary and Linguistic Computing, 7(1), 1–16.**
[@atkins1992cdc]

There are some very good points made in this article. However, those points will need to be fished out of a very detailed write-up on corpus design. Key points: (1) problems and practical solutions for defining populations with language phenomena, (2) text/ corpus typologies, and (3) defining text collection types. 

**Ädel, A. (2020). Corpus Compilation. In M. Paquot & S. Th. Gries (Eds.), A Practical Handbook of Corpus Linguistics (pp. 3–24). Springer.** [@Adel2020]

Provides a good summary of issues related to representativeness, balance, size in corpus sampling. It also highlights the fact that generalized corpora are most often left to groups of researchers and most researchers that compile a corpus will work with more specialized and opportunistic samples. Yet, considerations for research are fundamental to document and report to provide context for the research. It also discusses the important role of annotation --linguistic and non-linguistic (metadata) and the formats that these often take.
