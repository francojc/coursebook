Before jumping into the code, every researcher must come to a project with a clear idea about the purpose of the analysis. This means doing your homework in order to understand what it is exactly that you want to achieve; that is, you need to identify a research question. The first step is become versed in the previous literature on the topic. What has been written? What are the main findings? Secondly, it is important to become familiar with the standard methods for approaching the topic of interest. How has the topic been approached methodologically? What are the types, sources, and quality of data employed? What have been the statistical approaches employed? What particular statistical tests have been chosen? Getting an overview not only of the domain-specific findings in the literature but also the methodological choices will help you identify promising plan for carrying out your research.
