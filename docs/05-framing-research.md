Before jumping into the code, every researcher must come to a project with a clear idea about the purpose of the analysis. This means doing your homework in order to understand what it is exactly that you want to achieve; that is, you need to identify a research question. The first step is become versed in the previous literature on the topic. What has been written? What are the main findings? Secondly, it is important to become familiar with the standard methods for approaching the topic of interest. How has the topic been approached methodologically? What are the types, sources, and quality of data employed? What have been the statistical approaches employed? What particular statistical tests have been chosen? Getting an overview not only of the domain-specific findings in the literature but also the methodological choices will help you identify promising plan for carrying out your research.

__Characteristics of research: __ [@Cross2006]

+ Purposive: Based on identification of an issue or problem worthy and capable of investigation
+ Inquisitive: Seeking to acquire new knowledge
+ Informed: Conducted from an awareness of previous, related research
+ Methodical: Planned and carried out in a disciplined manner
+ Communicable: Generating and reporting results which are feasible and accessible by others
 


- _Research question_: identification of a particular area of uncertainty/ debate in knowledge
- _Unit of analysis_: entity of study which the research aims to use to investigate (determined by the research question)
- _Unit of observation_: component(s) which are collected to derive insight into the topic of study (unit of analysis) (determined by the data collection method). The primary unit of investigation is the essential focus of the informational structure of the dataset.

Chapter 5 "Designing your research project"

> Research design is essentially concerned with the basic architecture of research projects, with designing projects as systems that allow theory, data, and research methods to interface in such a way as to maximize a project’s ability to achieve its goals (see Figure 5.1). Research design involves a sequence of decisions that have to be taken in a project’s early stages, when one oversight or poor decision can lead to results that are ultimately trivial or untrustworthy. Thus, it is critically important to think carefully and systematically about research design before committing time and resources to acquiring texts or mastering software packages or programming languages for your text mining project.

Chapter 3 "Research Designs: Linguistically Meaningful Research Questions, Observational Units, Variables, and Dispersion"

- Research questions should drive decisions about the choice of observational unit, how variables are defined, and the choice of research design.
- Observational units can be defined at the level of the linguistic feature,
the text, or the corpus.
- Variables can be measured qualitatively, according to variants of a
linguistic feature, or quantitatively, using rates of occurrence for features.

Chapter 7 "Interpreting Quantitative Results"

- Linguistics is done by linguists, not by computers.
- In order to be useful, quantitative corpus linguistic analysis should be
coupled with sound qualitative interpretation.
- Researchers can rely on linguistic context, text-external context, and
linguistic theory to guide their interpretation of quantitative corpus findings.
